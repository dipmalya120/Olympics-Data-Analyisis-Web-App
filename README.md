# Olympics-Data-Analysis-Web-App
In this project, I've built a Web Application using Streamlit. Exploratory Data Analyisis have been performed on the '120 years of Olympic history' data set downloaded from Kaggle. For development, Python 3.10.4 and the Pandas library have been used. For plotting, I've used using Seaborn and Plotly libraries. The project is also deployed to Heroku.
